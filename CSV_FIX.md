# ðŸ”§ CSV File Loading Fix for Vercel

## Problem
```
Failed to load resource: 500 Internal Server Error
Error: "A server error occurred"
```

## Root Cause
The `indo_books.csv` file wasn't being included in the Vercel serverless function deployment package. Vercel only bundles files in the same directory as the Python function.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Copied CSV to api/ Directory
```bash
cp indo_books.csv api/indo_books.csv
```

Now the CSV is in the same directory as `api/index.py`, ensuring it gets bundled with the serverless function.

### 2. Updated File Path Resolution
Changed the code to check multiple paths in order:
```python
possible_paths = [
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'indo_books.csv'),  # Same dir (Vercel)
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'indo_books.csv'),  # Parent (local)
    'indo_books.csv',  # Current working dir
]
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
```python
print(f"Successfully loaded data from: {csv_path}")
```

This helps diagnose issues in Vercel logs.

## Files Changed
- âœ… `api/index.py` - Updated CSV loading logic
- âœ… `api/indo_books.csv` - Added copy of CSV to api directory

## Deploy Now! ðŸš€

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Include CSV in serverless function bundle"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- âœ… API endpoints return data instead of 500 errors
- âœ… Search works
- âœ… Recommendations work
- âœ… All features functional

**This will fix the 500 errors!** ðŸŽ‰
