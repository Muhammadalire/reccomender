# üîß CRITICAL FIX - Serverless Function Crash

## Error
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
This Serverless Function has crashed.
```

## Root Cause
**Missing import statement!**

In `api/index.py`, the Flask import was missing:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS  # ‚ùå Flask not imported!
```

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

Added the critical import:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  # ‚úÖ Now Flask is imported!
from flask_cors import CORS
```

## How This Caused the Crash

1. Python tried to execute `app = Flask(__name__)`
2. `Flask` was not defined (not imported)
3. NameError occurred
4. Serverless function crashed immediately
5. All API calls returned 500 errors

## Verification

Tested locally - works perfectly:
```bash
‚úÖ Import successful! App loaded: 7 routes
‚úÖ Successfully loaded 98 books
```

## Deploy Now! üöÄ

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will fix ALL 500 errors! üéâ

**The function will no longer crash!** ‚ú®
