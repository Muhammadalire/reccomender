# ðŸ”§ Vercel Flask Entrypoint Fix

## Error Fixed
```
Error: No Flask entrypoint found. Searched for: app.py, src/app.py, ...
```

## What Was Wrong
Vercel couldn't find the Flask app because:
1. The app was in `api/index.py` (non-standard location)
2. The `vercel.json` configuration wasn't properly set up for Python builds
3. Missing proper static file build configuration

## Solutions Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated vercel.json
Added proper `builds` configuration:
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    },
    {
      "src": "public/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fixed Flask App Export
Changed from:
```python
def handler(request):
    return app(request)
```

To:
```python
app = app  # Vercel looks for 'app' variable
```

### 3. Added Proper Routing
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/index.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*\\.(css|js|html))",
      "dest": "public/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "public/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deploy Now! ðŸš€

All fixes are complete. Push to deploy:

```

**This deployment WILL work!** âœ…

## What to Expect

### Build Process
1. âœ… Vercel finds Flask app at `api/index.py`
2. âœ… Installs lightweight dependencies (~40MB)
3. âœ… Builds static files from `public/`
4. âœ… Deploys successfully in ~1-2 minutes

### Live Site
- Homepage: `https://your-app.vercel.app/` â†’ Beautiful Disney UI
