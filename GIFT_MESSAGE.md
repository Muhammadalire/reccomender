My love,

I spent time creating something special for you - a magical book 
recommendation system! 🎁✨

Features I built just for you:
✨ Disney-styled design (because you love Disney!)
💖 Your favorite color palette (#F7A5A5, #FFDBB6, #1A2A4F, #FFF2EF)
📚 98 Indonesian books from your favorite genres
🔍 Smart search to find books you'll love
💝 Personalized recommendations based on what you like
🎲 "Surprise Me" for random discoveries
