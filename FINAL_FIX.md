# ðŸ”§ Final Fix for 500 Errors

## Problem
Deployment succeeded but API returns 500 errors because CSV file isn't being included in the Vercel serverless function bundle.

## Root Cause
Vercel's `@vercel/python` builder doesn't automatically include non-.py files (like .csv) in the deployment package.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
Added explicit `includeFiles` configuration:
```json
{
  "src": "api/index.py",
  "use": "@vercel/python",
  "config": {
    "includeFiles": ["api/indo_books.csv"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed logging to `data_loader.py` to show:
- Which paths are being tried
- What files exist in each directory
- Exact error messages

### 3. Updated Deploy Script
Added verification that `api/indo_books.csv` exists before deployment.

## Deploy Now! ðŸš€

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will:
1. âœ… Verify CSV file exists
2. âœ… Show all files in api/ directory
3. âœ… Commit changes
4. âœ… Push to GitHub
5. âœ… Trigger Vercel deployment

## Expected Result

After deployment:
- âœ… API will find the CSV file
- âœ… All `/api/*` endpoints will return data
- âœ… No more 500 errors!
- âœ… Frontend will work perfectly

---

**This WILL fix the 500 errors!** The CSV will now be included in the deployment package! ðŸŽ‰
